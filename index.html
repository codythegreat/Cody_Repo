<h1>BNKGLWorker</h1>
<p>This is a simple program that grabs amounts from a bank statement and places them into an excel file.
 The all will then compare these values with a row of amounts in another excel book to see if any amounts match.
 The app can also check to see if the addition of two amounts will equate to an amount on the bank statement. 
Once the app has check every amount for matches, it will append the results to the row to the right of the amounts, 
and save the workbooks.</p>
